        <h1>Eye of the Tiger</h1>
        <h2>Трек-Survivor</h2>
        <p>Rising up, back on the street <br>
            Did my time, took my chances <br>
            Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet <br>
            Just a man and his will to survive</p> <br>
        <p>So many times it happens too fast <br>
            You change your passion for glory <br>
            Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past <br>
            You must fight just to keep them alive</p> <br>
        <p> It's the eye of the tiger <br>
            It's the thrill of the fight <br>
            Rising up to the challenge of our rival <br>
            And the last known survivor <br>
            Stalks his prey in the night <br>
            And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger</p> <br>
        <p>Face to face, out in the heat <br>
            Hanging tough, staying hungry <br>
            They stack the odds 'til we take to the street <br>
            For the kill with the skill to survive</p> <br>
        <p>It's the eye of the tiger <br>
            It's the thrill of the fight <br>
            Rising up to the challenge of our rival <br>
            And the last known survivor <br>
            Stalks his prey in the night <br>
            And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger </p><br>
        <p>Rising up straight to the top <br>
            Had the guts, got the glory <br>
            Went the distance, now I'm not going to stop <br>
            Just a man and his will to survive</p> <br>
        <p>It's the eye of the tiger <br>
            It's the thrill of the fight <br>
            Rising up to the challenge of our rival <br>
            And the last known survivor <br>
            Stalks his prey in the night <br>
            And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger </p><br>
        <p>The eye of the tiger <br>
            The eye of the tiger <br>
            The eye of the tiger <br>
            The eye of the tiger</p>

        <h1>Time of dying</h1>
        <h2>Трек-Three Days Grace</h2>
        <p>On the ground I lay <br>
            Motionless in pain <br>
            I can see my life flashing before my eyes <br>
            Did I fall asleep <br>
            Is this all a dream? <br>
            Wake me up <br>
            I'm living a nightmare</p>
        <p>I will not die (I will not die) <br>
            I will survive</p>
        <p>I will not die, I'll wait here for you <br>
            I feel alive when you're beside me <br>
            I will not die, I'll wait here for you <br>
            In my time of dying</p>
        <p>On this bed I lay <br>
            Losing everything <br>
            I can see my life passing me by <br>
            Was it all too much <br>
            Or just not enough? <br>
            Wake me up <br>
            I'm living a nightmare</p>
        <p>I will not die (I will not die) <br>
            I will survive</p>
        <p>I will not die, I'll wait here for you <br>
            I feel alive when you're beside me <br>
            I will not die, I'll wait here for you <br>
            In my time of dying</p>
        <p>I will not die, I'll wait here for you <br>
            I feel alive when you're beside me <br>
            I will not die, I'll wait here for you <br>
            In my time of dying</p>

        <p>I will not die, I'll wait here for you <br>
            I feel alive when you're beside me <br>
            I will not die, I'll wait here for you <br>
